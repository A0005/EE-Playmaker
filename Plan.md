<h3>Program walk-through:</h2>

1 - Review Facilities <br/>

   - Rubbish Bins: Keep playing area clean. <br/>
   - A First Aid Kit: Will help treat basic injuries. This is a 'must have'. <br/>
   - Good Accessibility: Supports the needs of all players. <br/>
   - Parking: Keeps people away from vehicles and emergency areas clear. <br/>
   - Changing Rooms: Provide a private place to get ready. <br/>
   - Refreshment Areas: Provide food and drinking water. <br/>
   - Shelter: Protects from weather, like extreme rain or sun. <br/>
   - Different Surface Types: Can support your players, e.g. older individuals may prefer soft 3G pitches. <br/>
   - Time Slots: Should be early for young players. <br/>
   - Toilets: Promote hygiene and handwashing so make sure they're open. <br/>

2 - Check Safety <br/>

   - The Dog: They may be man's best friend, but dogs can be unpredictability, especially with balls flying around. <br/>
   - The Goal: Anything that's too near the edge of your playing area can cause a problem, e.g. collisions with an unsed goal or barrier.
               Whenever possible, make sure all areas are clearly marked and edges are free from obstruction. <br/>
   - The Broken Glass: Always check your area for hazards and address them before you begin playing.
                       Examples include broken glass, dog mess and holes where goalposts have been<br/>
   - The Puddle: Weather can have a big impact on saftey. If your playing area is wet or frozen, take care.
                 This is especially true on artificial grass where ice is hard to spot.
                 Issues can also arise if an area is too dry; soil could crack and cause a tripping hazard.<br/>
  
3 - Communicate With Players <br/>
      
   - Make sure they know: <br/>
   1 - When sessions are. <br/>
   2 - How long they last. <br/>
   3 - Where they happen. <br/>
   4 - How often they take place. <br/>
  
4 - Plan Your Sessions <br/>
      
   - STEP Framework: <br/>
   1 - S = space <br/>
   2 - T = task <br/>
   3 - E = equipment <br/>
   4 - P = people <br/>
