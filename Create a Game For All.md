   - Parking: Keeps people away from vehicles and emergency areas clear. <br/>

   - Refreshment Areas: Provide food and drinking water. <br/>

   - Toilets: Promote hygiene and handwashing so make sure they're open. <br/>

2 - Check Safety <br/>

   - The Dog: They may be man's best friend, but dogs can be unpredictability, especially with balls flying around. <br/>
   - The Goal: Anything that's too near the edge of your playing area can cause a problem, e.g. collisions with an unsed goal or barrier.
               Whenever possible, make sure all areas are clearly marked and edges are free from obstruction. <br/>
   - The Broken Glass: Always check your area for hazards and address them before you begin playing.
                       Examples include broken glass, dog mess and holes where goalposts have been<br/>
   - The Puddle: Weather can have a big impact on saftey. If your playing area is wet or frozen, take care.
                 This is especially true on artificial grass where ice is hard to spot.
                 Issues can also arise if an area is too dry; soil could crack and cause a tripping hazard.<br/>

   2 - T = task <br/>
   3 - E = equipment <br/>
   4 - P = people <br/>
